# Usage of NumPy for machine learning

The main goal of this lab is to create a program using Python for work with vectors and matrices using NumPy and SciPy.

## Task 1

Using random number generator fill in array with:
1. real numbers in range [0; 1]
2. integers in range [-10; 10]
3. positive integers in range [0; 50]

Given array of random numbers [a_1, ..., a_n], n is given by user.

Variant - 21: Write a program to create another array in which all elements are cyclically shifted by k elements to the left (e.g. k=1, [a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>]).

## Task 2

Using random number generator fill in matrix with:
1. real numbers in range [0; 1]
2. integers in range [-10; 10]
3. positive integers in range [0; 20]
4. real numbers in range [-10; 10]

Given matrix of random numbers [[а<sub>11</sub>, ..., a<sub>1n</sub>], ..., [а<sub>m1</sub>, ..., a<sub>mn</sub>]], n and m are given by user.

Variant - 21: Write a program that will create new matrix with 2 rows swapped: row with min element and row with max element.
