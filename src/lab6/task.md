# Work with data using Pandas library

The main goal of this lab is to create a program using Python for work with data using K-nearest neighbors algorithm

1. Load data from `sklearn.datasets` according to variant
2. Output feature description
3. Output first 5 records of data
4. Create test and training subsets
5. Use K-nearest neighbors algorithm
6. Train for different values of k
7. Check accuracy of learning

Variant - 9: LFW dataset (`fetch_lfw_pairs`)
